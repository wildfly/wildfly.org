== WildFly S2I (Source To Image) images

In April we announced the new WildFly architecture for the cloud. (link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2022/04/20/WildFly-s2i-v2-Released/[WildFly architecture for the cloud]. I strongly 
encourage you to read this post to get familiar with this new architecture.

We have discontinued the release of WildFly s2i centos7 based images starting WildFly 26.1.2. 
We are now only releasing UBI8 based JDK11/JDK17 s2i builder and runtime images as well as  
Galleon link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack[wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack] for new features and bug fixes.

The latest artifacts that form the WildFly cloud experience are:

* WildFly Source-to-Image (S2I) builder images (link:https://quay.io/repository/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk11[JDK11] and link:https://quay.io/repository/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk17[JDK17])
* WildFly runtime images (link:https://quay.io/repository/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk11[JDK11] and link:https://quay.io/repository/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk17[JDK17])
* link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin/[WildFly Maven plugin 4.0.0.Final] 
* link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack[WildFly cloud Galleon feature-pack 2.0.0.Final] 
* link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack[WildFly datasources Galleon feature-pack 3.0.0.Final] 
* link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-charts[Helm Chart for WildFly 2.x]

== New features overview

* Generation of efficient WildFly s2i builder image. This feature, covered in detail in this blog post, is specified in this link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/issues/393[enhancement description]. 
The environment variables that allow you to configure an S2I build to produce a WildFly S2I builder for a given WildFly server 
can be found link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules/blob/main/jboss/container/wildfly/s2i/2.0/legacy/module.yaml[there].

* `cloud-server` and `postgresql-server` WildFly s2i builders. The Maven projects link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/wildfly-builders/cloud-server[cloud-server] and link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/wildfly-builders/postgresql-server[postgresql-server] 
define s2i builders maven project and Helm chart for WildFly yaml file that you can re-use to build s2i builders. Such builders will then be usable 
to build your application images in an efficient way. This link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/examples/optimized-builder[example] highlights the usage of the generated builders.

* Support to automatically discover and register the deployments to be secured with OIDC. This support complies with this link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/434[WildFly proposal].
This support is based on the `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem. It is equivalent to the Keycloak OIDC support provided in the legacy images.
The environment variables that allow you to configure the server can be found link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules/blob/main/jboss/container/wildfly/launch/oidc/module.yaml[there].

* Enable Overriding env var. This feature, enabled by default in WildFly s2i images, is specified by this link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/404[proposal].
WildFly on the cloud relies on container environment variables to customize its configuration to the container platform. 
It is difficult to change the value of a management attribute from the standalone configuration if the attribute does not provide a default value with an expression 
that can be resolved at runtime. This feature introduces a generic mechanism to let user override any __simple__ management attribute 
using environment variables. Complex attributes (of type `OBJECT`, `LIST`, `PROPERTY`) are not impacted by this change.

As an example, the user could set an env var when starting WildFly to change the value of this `proxy-address-forwarding` attribute with 
the env var `SUBSYSTEM_UNDERTOW_SERVER_DEFAULT_SERVER_HTTP_LISTENER_DEFAULT__PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING`.


* Image streams that you can import in OpenShift and use with helm Charts:

== WildFly S2I builder generation

One of the main feedback we got for this new architecture is that an s2i build takes more time compared to legacy WildFly s2i images. 
That is due to the maven resolution of the WildFly server artifacts (JBoss Modules modules jar retrieved from remote maven repositories) during provisioning.
Although `incremental-build` (re-use of the maven cache from previous build) is enabled by default when using Helm chart for WildFly, when building multiple 
applications, `incremental build` is not an answer, the maven local cache can't be shared among different build configs.

In order to provide an answer to this issue, we have made the WildFly s2i builder image able to generate an S2i builder image for a given trimmed server. 
Such builder contains an installed WildFly server in `$JBOSS_HOME` (`/opt/server`) in which deployment built during the next s2i phase is deployed. 
This kind of builder offers an efficient build phase, no more provisioning is operated when building the application.

The builder image size is also reduced compared to the legacy WildFly s2i builder image. The image contains only the needed trimmed server artifacts.

NB: An interesting aspect of generated builders is that they can be shared across the s2i builds of application deployments that require the same server capabilities.


The following diagrams covers the three S2I workflows.

=== 2 phases S2I build workflow based on generated builder

image::s2iv2/Generated_Builder_S2I_workflow.jpg[generated builder]

When building such WildFly s2i builder, the Maven and s2i environment variables that you would need to use (eg: configure maven repositories, maven args, ...) 
need to be isolated in order to not collide with the same environment variables one could set when using the generated builder.
For this isolation, you need to suffix any env variable with `_WILDFLY_SERVER_BUILDER` (for example `MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND_WILDFLY_SERVER_BUILDER`). 
The suffix is automatically removed during build and the proper environment variable is exported.

A WildFly s2i builder is built from sources (actually just a pom.xml file) located inside a maven project. The WildFly Maven Plugin is used to provision the server, configured 
with the Galleon layers of your choice (eg: `jaxrs-server`, `cloud-server+ejb`, ...). The Galleon layers to use is not limited to the WildFly Galleon layers. 
You can use different Galleon feature-packs to build-up your server. 
This link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/blob/main/wildfly-builders/postgresql-server/pom.xml[pom.xml] file contains the provisioning of a cloud-server + postgresql driver and datasource 
that the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack[wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack] defines.

To make WildFly s2i builder generation possible using Helm chart for WildFly, we have evolved it with the following support:

* Ability to disable the chained build that produces an application image. That is done thanks to the new `build.s2i.buildApplicationImage` property sets to `false`. 
When set to `false`, the name of the generated image is the name of the chart. For example `helm install cloud-server-builder -f helm.yaml wildfly/wildfly` 
will produce an Openshift imagestream named `cloud-server-builder`. The suffix `-build-artifacts` that is appended when the chained build is enabled is not added.
The generated imagestream is what will then be used when building your application using the generated builder.

* Ability to set different kind of image for the s2i builder image and the runtime image. By default the WildFly s2i docker images are used for s2i build 
and chained build. In the context of a generated builder, the builder is of type imagestream (`ImageStreamTag` or `ImageStreamImage`). 
You can set the builder type using the `build.s2i.builderKind` property. 

This link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/blob/main/wildfly-builders/cloud-server/helm.yaml[helm chart] file 
shows how to configure an s2i build to produce a WildFly s2i builder.

== New Examples

WildFly 27 supports only Jakarta EE 10, the link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/examples[WildFly s2i examples] 
have been migrated to jakarta EE 10.

In addition to the set of examples that we introduced for WildFLy 26, new examples have been included:

* Automatic discovery and registration of deployments secured with keycloak OIDC protocol link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/examples/elytron-oidc-client-auto-reg[example].

* A JMS broker, message provider and consumer link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/examples/jms-broker[example] that relies on the new `embedded-activemq` Galleon layer that WildFly provides.

* An link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/examples/postgresql-multiple-datasources[example] to provision a postgresql driver and 
multiple datasources.

* An link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/main/examples/optimized-builder[example] that highlights the new "WildFly s2i builder" generation features.

== Enjoy!

We hope that you will see an interest in these new features. 
As usual we need your feedback to evolve WildFly on the cloud in the right direction. Feel free to log these as new 
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/issues[project issues].

Thank-you!
