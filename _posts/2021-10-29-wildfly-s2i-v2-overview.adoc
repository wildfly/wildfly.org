For upcoming link:http://docs.wildfly.org[WildFly] 26 release we are re-architecting link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/[WildFly S2I (Source to Image)] 
images to offer more flexibility, better efficiency and a simpler user experience.

Since WildFly 16, in which we introduced an evolution of the WildFly s2i images, we have identified a set of pain points 
that we want to see addressed in a new architecture:

* Strong coupling of the WildFly S2I builder image with a WildFly release. This implies that new builder images have 
to be released and deployed for each new server version.

* Configuring the server during the S2I build is complex. Executing the simplest WildFly CLI script during build is far from trivial;
it requires your application project to comply with a specific directory structure then you must define bash 
scripts (do you know Java developers who like to write bash scripts?) in order to call CLI command lines (and don't forget to start the embedded server). 
The simplest copy of some extra server content (e.g. JBoss Module modules) is also not that trivial and again requires bash scripting.

* Executing your own CLI scripts during server startup implies having installed some extensions (again bash scripts) inside the server during the S2I build.

* Server startup is always composed of a sequence of 2 steps -- server starts first in admin only mode and automatically applies 
generated CLI scripts, then reboots in normal mode. In cases your server configuration doesn't require some adjustments 
and could have booted directly in normal mode.

* No simple way to provide server arguments (e.g. Java system properties) when starting the server.

* No way to tailor a server according to the application needs from the project `pom.xml` file. Server provisioning during the S2I build is configured 
by env variables provided at S2I build time.

* No way to build and run an application with a link:https://docs.wildfly.org/25/WildFly_and_WildFly_Preview.html[WildFly Preview] server.

* WildFly S2I images contain much more than what we actually need to build and run the server. We need a much lighter Operating System.

## New WildFly S2I architecture

The current architecture is composed of 2 main artifacts:

* WildFly S2I builder image with JDK11 based on centos7. Image released for each new WildFly release (to contain the latest release of the WildFly server).

* WildFly S2I runtime image with JDK11 based on centos7. Image used to create docker chained builds to output smaller runtime application images.

We are keeping the separation between the S2I builder image and the runtime image. The 2 new images we are offering are:

* WildFly S2I builder image with JDK11 based on 
link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi-minimal/5c359a62bed8bd75a2c3fba8[ubi8 minimal]. 
This image doesn't contain a WildFly server. It expects a server containing the application deployment to be provisioned during the S2I build phase.

* WildFly runtime image with JDK11 based on 
link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi-minimal/5c359a62bed8bd75a2c3fba8[ubi8 minimal]. 
We are keeping the JDK (instead of a JRE) in order to make Java debugging tools available in the image. 
This image can be used to run any WildFly server (not only a server provisioned using the builder image in a chained build).

For now we will only be providing JDK 11 versions of these images.

So the WildFly S2I builder image becomes a lightweight generic image allowing to build and execute applications deployed in any WildFly server.

### New s2i build workflow

We are removing the complex server configuration points and rely on the use of the 
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin/[WildFly Maven plugin] that can now provision a fully configured server containing your deployment. 
The WildFly Maven plugin `3.0.0.Alpha1` has been evolved with some new goals to provision, configure, and package the server and the deployment in one step. 
When designing your application pom file, add the WildFly Maven plugin `package` goal, configure it with the link:https://docs.wildfly.org/25/Galleon_Guide.html#wildfly-galleon-feature-packs[WildFly Galleon feature-pack]
and link:https://docs.wildfly.org/25/Galleon_Guide.html#wildfly_layers[Galleon layer(s)], and optionally reference WildFly CLI scripts to be executed and 
content to be copied inside the server. At the end of the build you will get (by default in the `target/server` directory) 
a server with your app deployed, ready to be installed in the image.

In order to allow for a smooth transition to the new images, we are still supporting (in a deprecated way) the legacy workflow. 
Your existing application would work, but you are now required to specify the Galleon feature-pack(s) and layer(s) 
(`GALLEON_PROVISION_FEATURE_PACKS` and `GALLEON_PROVISION_LAYERS` env variables) 
you want to see used during the S2I build to provision a WildFly server.

### New image runtime API

An image built from the WildFly S2I builder or runtime images both expose 
the same API allowing you to fine tune the server execution.
This API is exposed by means of environment variables to be set when configuring your deployment.

#### JVM configuration API

The JVM link:https://github.com/jboss-openshift/cct_module/tree/master/jboss/container/java/jvm/api/module.yaml[env variables] 
that are used today with WildFly s2i images are still supported. They are a nice way to tune the JVM.

#### WildFly server startup configuration API

The new server startup configuration API is described in this 
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules/blob/v2/jboss/container/wildfly/run/api/module.yaml[documentation]. 
This API comes with default values that should cover the main use-cases. 2 env variables open-up new possibilities:

* `SERVER_ARGS` allows you to pass WildFly server arguments when starting the server.

* `CLI_LAUNCH_SCRIPT` allows you to provide a path (relative to `JBOSS_HOME` or absolute) to a CLI script to be executed at startup time. Although CLI scripts 
should be executed at build time from the WildFly Maven plugin, in some cases it can be useful to adjust the configuration at execution time. You can package 
a set of CLI scripts inside your server at build time, then reference one of these CLI scripts to be executed at runtime. 

#### WildFly server subsystems configuration API

If you are using WildFly s2i images you are perhaps asking yourself where are the env variables you have been using 
to configure the elytron subsystem, to add datasources, to configure logging or the microprofile-config subsystem,... 
They are provided by means of a new link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack[WildFly cloud Galleon feature-pack] 
that you can combine with the WildFly Galleon feature-pack at build time to produce a server supporting these env variables.

* If you only provision `org.wildfly:wildfly-galleon-pack:25.0.0.Final` you will get a "vanilla" WildFly server that 
will get lightly adjusted by the image entry-point to properly execute on OpenShift.

* If you provision `org.wildfly:wildfly-galleon-pack:25.0.0.Final` and `org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack:1.0.0.Alpha2` 
you will get a similar server to the one present in the current WildFly s2i image (with `JBOSS_HOME/bin/openshift-launch.sh` launcher). 

## Examples

You can pull the new WildFly S2i images (Beta quality) from quay.io:

* `docker pull quay.io/jfdenise/wildfly-s2i-jdk11`
* `docker pull quay.io/jfdenise/wildfly-runtime-jdk11`
 
NB: The images will be made available from the `quay.io/wildfly` organisation when they reach a Final quality.


### S2I examples

We have defined a set of link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/v2/examples[examples] to help 
you get started. They cover different use-cases that highlight the new capabilities.

The examples rely on link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/05/05/helm-charts-for-wildfly/[WildFly Helm Charts] 
to automate the build and deployment on OpenShift.

In order to deploy the examples onto OpenShift, you can log in to the 
link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift].

The use cases covered are:

* link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/v2/examples/jsf-ejb-jpa/README.md[Simple application], no specific configuration. Just build and deploy on OpenShift.

* link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/v2/examples/elytron-oidc-client/README.md[Keycloak integration]. Use WildFly 25 `elytron-oidc-client` 
to interact with a Keycloak server. Also highlights the ability to provide server arguments at launch time.

* link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/v2/examples/logging/README.md[Logging]. We all need to enable logging at some point. 
With a simple CLI script executed at server boot time, enable logging and redirect all traces to the CONSOLE.

* link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/v2/examples/web-clustering/README.md[Clustering]. A cluster of PODS 
that share web sessions. This example benefits from the WildFly cloud feature-pack and WildFly Helm Charts capabilities
to automatically enable the `dns.DNS_PING` JGroups protocol and generate the ping service.

### Dockerfile example

This chapter highlights the steps to build a docker image that contains the server and your application, 
publish it in a public docker registry in which you have an account (e.g. link:http://quay.io[quay.io]) and then deploy it on OpenShift. 
Here we are using the link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/tree/v2/examples/jsf-ejb-jpa/README.md[Simple application] example. 
NB: Be sure to update the example steps with your own docker registry account.

* Build the maven project:

``
$ mvn clean package
``

* Write a Dockerfile with the following content:

```
FROM quay.io/jfdenise/wildfly-runtime-jdk11:latest
COPY --chown=jboss:root target/server $JBOSS_HOME
RUN chmod -R ug+rwX $JBOSS_HOME
```

* Build the image

``
$ docker build -t quay.io/jfdenise/my-app:latest .
``

* You can run the image locally and interact with the application (e.g. http://docker_container_IP:8080).

``
$ docker run --rm quay.io/jfdenise/my-app:latest
``

* Publish the image

``
$ docker push quay.io/jfdenise/my-app:latest
``

* Write a WildFly Heml Charts `my-app.yaml` file with the following content:

```
image:
  name: quay.io/jfdenise/my-app
build:
  enabled: false
```

* Deploy on OpenShift

``
helm install my-app -f my-app.yaml wildfly_v2/wildfly
``

* Once deployed, access the application route URL (e.g. https://my-app-jdenise-stage.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/) 

## To conclude

We hope that, like us, you will see the benefits of this new approach (for which you can perhaps find similarities 
with the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/[WildFly bootable JAR] S2I experience).
This is going to allow us to offer more flexibility (provision the server of your choice), better efficiency (smaller images, faster server startup),
simpler user experience (WildFly Maven plugin configuration is far simpler than the existing S2I configuration points). 
So in the end a much better overall experience.

Keep us posted with your feedback. (You can log these as new 
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/issues[project issues].) This will help us evolve the new WildFly S2I experience in the right direction.

Thank-you!
