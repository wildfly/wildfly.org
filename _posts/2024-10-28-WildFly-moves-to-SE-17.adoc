//= WildFly has moved to an SE 17 baseline

As I noted in the link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2024/10/17/WildFly34-Released/[WildFly 34 release announcement, window=_blank], our plan is that WildFly 34.x will be the final release series that would run on Java SE 11. Beginning with the WildFly 35 release, the minimum Java SE version for a WildFly server will be SE 17.

We have now executed on this plan by updating the WildFly 'main' branch to build SE 17 binaries. *If you are consuming WildFly nightly builds or building WildFly snapshots, you will need to move to an SE 17 baseline in those workflows. Any WildFly 35 releases will require SE 17 as a minimum.*

NOTE: We recommend that you run WildFly on SE 21, as that is the latest supported LTS release.

NOTE: The WildFly 34.0.1 release will support SE 11. If we do any further releases in the 34.x series, they will support SE 11.

The primary driver for this change is the fact that libraries we integrate are beginning to withdraw SE 11 support in their feature development branches and the availability of bug fix releases in older branches is increasingly uncertain. We also don't wish to continue to act as an innovation constraint on projects we integrate that are looking to move past SE 11.

We recognize that changing SE versions can be a significant task for some users, so we didn't make this decision lightly. I hope that the fact that WildFly has supported SE 17 since the WildFly 25 release has made it easier for our users to prepare for this change.

Best regards,

Brian
