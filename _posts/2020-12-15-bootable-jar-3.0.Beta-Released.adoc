The 3.0.0.Beta1 version of the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/[WildFly bootable JAR Maven plugin] has been released.

This  https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/releases/tag/3.0.0.Beta1[release]  is not yet Final, 
it is "just a beta", but we think that it is of enough good quality to acquire feedback on it.

For people who are not familiar with WildFly bootable JAR, I strongly recommend that you read 
this link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2020/10/19/bootable-jar-2.0-released/[blog post] that covers it in details. 

In addition to bug fixes, this release brings 2 new goals:

* `help`: to display the plugin goals and configuration elements descriptions. 
* `dev-watch`: an evolution of the `dev` goal that makes repackaging of your application no more required. 

## Dev-watch goal

The current `dev` goal, although offering an efficient workflow to develop WildFly applications, requires an explicit repackaging of your application. 
This is currently done in two steps:

* `mvn wildfly-jar:dev` 
** that builds and starts the server in background. The deployment scanner monitors the `target/deployments` directory for new deployed content.
* `mvn package -Ddev`
** that builds your application then copy the deployment to the `target/deployments` directory.
* Update your src, re-call `mvn package -Ddev`
* When done call `mvn wildfly-jar:shutdown`
** that kills the running server (NB: requires the `management` layer to be provisioned).
 
So each time a change is made to your application, `mvn package -Ddev` must be called for the deployment to be re-deployed. 

Furthermore, when the plugin configuration located in the pom.xml file is modified (e.g.: a new Galleon layer is added), 
when a CLI script is updated or when some extra content is added, the running server must be killed and `wildfly-jar:dev` must then be re-called.

This knowledge of when to re-build a bootable JAR, when to stop/re-start it, when to re-build your sources and when to re-deploy 
is now under the control of the `dev-watch` goal.

The new workflow introduced by the goal is:

* `mvn wildfly-jar:dev-watch`
** that builds your application (if needed), builds and starts the server, deploys your application and finally watches for file changes in your project.
** Note that this call is blocking. The `dev-watch` goal and the server write traces to the console.
* Update your files.
** changes are detected. The goal advertises in the console what is the action it is taking (re-build, re-deploy, …). 
* Refresh your browser (if needed) to access the re-deployed application.
* When done, send `Ctrl-C` in the shell.

Integration in IDE is straightforward. As an example I have created a Maven action named 'dev-watch' that calls `wildfly-jar:dev-watch` 
goal in link:https://netbeans.org/[NetBeans IDE]. Once called, the goal traces are displayed in the IDE output windows. You can then forget 
about the execution and start modifying your files in the IDE and refresh your web browser to visualize changes.  

## New Examples

We have added some new examples:

* An link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/3.0.0.Beta1/examples/jaxws[example] that shows how to use the link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html#gal.webservices[webservices] Galleon layer.
* An link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/3.0.0.Beta1/examples/gradle-mdb-rar[example] that shows how to integrate the Maven plugin from Graddle.
* An link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/3.0.0.Beta1/examples/mdb-rar[example] that shows how to deploy activemq rar file and 
use the https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html#gal.ejb[ejb] Galleon layer.

## Plugin configuration changes

We have fixed the `extraServerContent` configuration element to be `extraServerContentDirs`. That was required to align 
its name with the `extra-server-content-dirs` alias. If you are already using  `extra-server-content-dirs` (that is the advised way), 
then nothing change for you, if you are using `extraServerContent`, you will have to update your pom file.

## To conclude

We hope that you are seeing the benefits of the new features that this release is bringing.
We would really appreciate your link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues[feedback] on the `dev-watch` goal. We aim toward a smooth and efficient 
first class WildFly developer experience and we need you there!

Thank-you.
