= WildFly 28 Beta1 is released!

I'm pleased to announce that the new WildFly and WildFly Preview 28.0.0.Beta1 releases are available for download at https://wildfly.org/downloads.

== New and Notable

*Observability*

The biggest changes in WildFly 28 Beta1 relate to the observability space.

* The `micrometer` subsystem has been link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17144[added to standard WildFly], bringing link:https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] support. As part of this work, we've added support for link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17681[Micrometer integration with our MicroProfile Fault Tolerance implementation]. The `micrometer` subsystem was first introduced in WildFly Preview in WildFly 27. Note that the subsystem has been updated from what was in WildFly Preview 27 to switch to pushing metric data via OTLP to a remote collector, instead of supporting polling of data on the WildFly server's management interface. (Server and JVM metrics can still be pulled from the management endpoint if the link:https://docs.wildfly.org/27/Admin_Guide.html#MicroProfile_Metrics_SmallRye[base `metrics` subsystem] is configured.)
* We've also added support for link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-telemetry-1.0/tracing/microprofile-telemetry-tracing-spec-1.0.html[MicroProfile Telemetry] via a link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17156[new `microprofile-telemetry-smallrye` subsystem].
* We've removed support for MicroProfile Metrics, except for a link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17138[stub system limited to 'admin-only' mode] that's been kept to facilitate configuration migration. MicroProfile Metrics users are encouraged to use the new `micrometer` subsystem.
* We've removed support for MicroProfile OpenTracing, except for a link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17510[stub system limited to 'admin-only' mode] that's been kept to facilitate configuration migration. MicroProfile OpenTracing users are encouraged to use the new `microprofile-telemetry-smallrye` subsystem, or the `opentelemetry` subsystem upon which it is based.

*MicroProfile*

Besides the changes in the observability space noted above, there are a couple of important changes in WildFly 28's MicroProfile support:

* We've link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14869[added support] for link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-2.0/microprofile-lra-spec-2.0.html[MicroProfile LRA] via new `microprofile-lra-coordinator` and `microprofile-lra-participant` subsystems.
* Except for MicroProfile Metrics and OpenTracing, which have been removed, we've updated our support for the other MicroProfile Platform specifications to the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/6.0[MicroProfile Platform 6] versions.

*Provisioning*

* We've added a new link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17648[`ee-core-profile-server` Galleon layer] to make it easy to provision a server based on the new link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/coreprofile/10/[Jakarta EE Core Profile] introduced in EE 10.
* Related to this we've introduced new link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13355[`ee-concurrency` and `ee-integration`] and link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17804[`servlet`] Galleon layers. These layers allow a more tailored configuration compared to the existing `ee` and `web-server` layers.

*Other Treats*

* The clustering team has added support for link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13520[Infinispan query, counters, locks, and CDI].
* The clustering and web teams have added support for link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-16043[configuration of an arbitrary cookie to use for web request affinity].
* The RESTEasy team has added support for link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-16018[including request tracing information in HTTP response headers].
* The `messaging-activemq` subsystem now supports link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-7232[integrating an SSLContext provided by the `elytron` subsystem].
* When you use OIDC, the security team has added support for link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-16793[identity propagation from a WAR to an EJB in an EAR].
* The web team has added link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14980[default values for the `read-timeout` and `write-timeout` settings] for Undertow listeners.
* We've updated Hibernate ORM from the ORM 6.1 release to 6.2.0.CR4.
