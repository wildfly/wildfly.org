Hello everyone. I recently revamped the WildFly.ORG website, and I hope
you will find it to be a much more useful source of information about
the WildFly project.

Walkthrough
-----------
I'd like to take you through a short tour of whatâ€™s on the website. The website
is based on the https://github.com/jbossorg/bootstrap-community[JBoss community bootstrap theme].
So it should operate in a familiar manner to other JBoss community websites.

Main Landing Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first page aims to keep you up to date with the latest WildFly news and
events. 

The rotating banners in the center are clickable and will take you into an 
area that provides more information about the banner subject.

Below the banners we have the latest WildFly news, which is a specialized blog
that will contain articles that we think Wildfly users, such as yourself, will
find interesting. If you click on the RSS looking icon in the "Latest News" title
you will get an atom feed for the news.

Clicking on the title links will take you into the article and display some information 
about the author. Aside from regular bloggers on the development team, we
will post guest articles from community members with interesting WildFly experiences
they would like to share. Let us know if you are interested!

On the right bottom section, our WildFlyAS twitter account will post interesting tweets, and
frequently retweet WildFly commenters. If you like to talk about WildFly on twitter,
you will probably see your tweets pop up here from time to time.

About Page
~~~~~~~~~~
If you click link:{base_url}/about/[About] in the navigation bar, you'll find a list of compelling 
reasons to use WildFly for your next project. We are certainly proud of
what it has become.

News Page
~~~~~~~~~
The link:{base_url}/news/[News] page displays a number of entries at once, so you can catch up quickly. 

Downloads
~~~~~~~~~
The link:{base_url}/downloads/[Downloads] page displays a list of all WildFly releases since 8. For older
releases you will need to visit the older
http://jboss.org/projects/jbossas[JBoss AS Community] page. If you are interested
in our commercial offering, JBoss EAP, those releases are also referenced on that page.

All of the 8 binaries have multiple download options, so be sure to look carefully 
for the option and format you prefer.

Finally, we highly recommend reviewing the release notes icon at the bottom of each 
download entry. We always announce important information about the release regarding compatibility
and known issues.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Documentation[Documentation] link will take you into our official WildFly documentation, 
which is maintained in separate Confluence system. We allow comments, so if you
have suggestions on how we can improve a particular page in the documentation, 
let us know!

Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~
This takes you to our GitHub repository. From here you can search, browse, and fork our code.

Get Help
~~~~~~~~
The link:{base_url}/gethelp/[Get Help] section covers the various options available to get in touch with the WildFly community.
These include our web based forums, mailing lists, and chat.

Join Us
~~~~~~~
Since WildFly is a community project, we only exist because various developers around the world
have decided to pitch in and help build a great application server. We are always looking
for new volunteers, and the link:{base_url}/joinus/[Join Us] page will expand on the many benefits of doing so. It also provides helpful information to new contributors.

Governance
~~~~~~~~~~
On the bottom footer there is a link to a page describing how we link:{base_url}/governance/[govern the WildFly project]. If 
you are evaluating the project, you might find it useful to understand how we plan and develop it.
