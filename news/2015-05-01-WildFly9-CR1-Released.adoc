I'm happy to announce link:{base_url}/downloads/[WildFly 9.0.0.CR1]! WildFly 9 builds off of WildFly 8's Java EE7 support, and adds many new capabilities, including intelligent load balancing, HTTP/2 support, a new offline CLI mode, graceful single node shutdown, and a new Servlet-only distribution. For more details, check out the link:https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/WildFly900CR1ReleaseNotes[full release notes].

Provided no major issues are discovered, we plan to move to Final fairly quickly, sometime in May.

Enjoy!
