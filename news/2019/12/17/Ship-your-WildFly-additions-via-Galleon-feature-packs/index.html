<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/wildfly/galleon">Galleon</a> is a tool for provisioning Java runtimes. It comes
with <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/galleon-plugins">plugins</a> for provisioning WildFly server
instances. We have been using it internally in WildFly to build and configure the server the past
few releases, and we recently introduced it into our OpenShift cloud image to be able to create a
server with a smaller footprint than the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This post will give an overview of how to use Galleon to provide your additions to WildFly so that
users can easily install them. The intended audience is someone who is familiar with writing WildFly
subsystems, and how our JBoss Modules classloading system works. We will see how this is a great way for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Third-party vendors to ship their products which are intended to run on top of WildFly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shipping experimental features that we don’t want in the main WildFly code base yet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up until recently there was not really any standard way to do this. You would need one of the following options:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have your code included in the main <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly">WildFly code base</a>.
This is not really a realistic option for a lot of people since what we put into there is mainly
driven by where we, the WildFly community, want WildFly to go next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide your subsystem via other means, for example a script to copy your additions into an existing
WildFly installation and add them to the configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="template-galleon-feature-pack-repository">Template Galleon feature pack repository</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This blog post references a <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template">repository</a>
which extends WildFly with a generic subsystem whose only job is to make a CDI <code>@Produces</code> method available
to deployments. The repository also contains the needed bits to have an Arquillian test suite running
outside of the WildFly code base, and of course to create the Galleon feature pack. The subsystem code
is basic, as the intent is for you to be able to use this repository as a template for creating your own
Galleon feature packs. This is not meant to be an in-depth guide, more a high level overview to get you
started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The template repository
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/README.md">README</a> goes into
more depth in some areas. Also, as people provide feedback, its explanation of how things work can
evolve independently of the static snapshot of information contained in this blog post.
The <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/tree/blog-post-snapshot">blog-post-snapshot</a> tag is
from when this blog post was written.</p>

<h2 id="initial-run">Initial run</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are impatient, you can simply run:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$mvn install
$./build/target/wildfly-&lt;WildFly Version&gt;-template-&lt;Template Version&gt;/bin/standalone.sh</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The server in the <code>build/target</code> directory is a trimmed down version of ‘official’ WildFly with our
subsystem added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then in another terminal window:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$mvn package wildfly:deploy -pl example</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/example/greeting" class="bare">http://localhost:8080/example/greeting</a> and you will see a greeting message. This message comes
from the CDI <code>@Produces</code> method made available by the template’s subsystem, and the language used for the
message changes as you refresh the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will look at various ways of customising your WildFly server with our feature pack later in this post.</p>

<h2 id="core-galleon-concepts">Core Galleon concepts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/">Galleon documentation</a> discusses the concepts in depth but we
will summarise some of the core concepts which we have used for this template, mainly to make sense of
what we have done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Package</strong> - A package is file system content that should be included in the built server. In our example
this means JBoss Modules for our subsystem and its dependency, and also licenses. A package may have a
<strong>task</strong> to run when it is installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Features</strong> and <strong>Feature groups</strong> - we use a feature to add configuration for our subsystem to the WildFly
configuration. Features can be added to groups. Features and feature groups may (among other things) have
dependencies on other features and feature groups, and may include dependencies on packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Layers</strong> - Layers split up the server into fine-grained bits, so that we can pick and choose exactly the
parts we want. For example you could ask for a WildFly server just implementing JAX-RS (and its dependencies)
and not implementing the management interfaces. The resulting server will be a lot smaller than the one you
download from <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/" class="bare">https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/</a>. Layers can have dependencies on other layers, e.g. when
asking for JAX-RS it will also install the web server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a list of all our layers defined by WildFly and WildFly Core in our
<a href="https://docs.wildfly.org/18/Admin_Guide.html#wildfly-galleon-layers">documentation</a>. If you want to
understand better what their dependencies are, you can look at the <code>layer-spec.xml</code> for the various layers
that make up WildFly in the following locations</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>WildFly Core&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/tree/10.0.3.Final/core-galleon-pack/src/main/resources/layers/standalone">Core Feature Pack</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WildFly&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/18.0.1.Final/servlet-galleon-pack/src/main/resources/layers/standalone">Servlet Feature Pack</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WildFly&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/18.0.1.Final/galleon-pack/src/main/resources/layers/standalone">Full Feature Pack</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above links take you to the versions used for WildFly 18.0.1.Final; adjust them to see what is
available in other server versions. Once you have read this article and browsed the template repository
you should be able to work out what all those files contain.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="the-template-subsystem-galleon-feature-pack">The template subsystem Galleon feature pack</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section will explain our feature pack. Let’s take a quick look at its packages, feature groups, layers,
feature pack configuration, and the build.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have some packages which contain the JBoss Modules for our subsystem and its dependency. These can be
found under the
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/tree/master/galleon-pack/src/main/resources/modules/system/layers/base">galleon-pack/src/main/resources/modules/system/layers/base/</a>
directory. The subsystem code is in the <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/tree/master/subsystem">subsystem/</a>
folder of the project, while the example subsystem dependency (which contains the CDI <code>@Produces</code> method
mentioned) code is in the
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/tree/master/subsystem">dependency/</a>
folder of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition we have some packages to deal with installing licenses for your added libraries. We won’t go into
details of that here. See the the template <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="feature-groups">Feature Groups</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We define a single feature group in <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/galleon-pack/src/main/resources/feature_groups/template-subsystem.xml">galleon-pack/src/main/resources/feature_groups/template-subsystem.xml</a>.
The group contains the <code>&lt;feature spec="subsystem.template-subsystem"/&gt;</code> for our subsystem. The value of
'spec' used for these feature specifications is of the form</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>subsystem.&lt;subsystem name in the model&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and it essentially configures the subsystem. In this case <code>&lt;subsystem name in the model&gt;</code> is 'template-subsystem',
and this configuration results in a</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>/subsystem=template-subsystem:add()</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>when provisioning the server. Our subsystem is empty, if it had some attributes that need setting they would also be
defined in the feature spec.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="layers">Layers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/galleon-pack/src/main/resources/layers/standalone/template-layer/layer-spec.xml">galleon-pack/src/main/resources/layers/standalone/template-layer/layer-spec.xml</a>
contains our single layer called ‘template-layer’. It adds dependencies on the following other constructs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>dependency</strong> on the <code>cdi</code> layer. This is needed so that when we install our layer, which uses CDI,
Galleon will automatically pull in the CDI dependencies as well if they are not already there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>feature group</strong> we already discussed. When this layer is installed, our subsystem gets configured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any additional <strong>packages</strong> (i.e. content) needed. In this case there are none, since we add the dependency
on the subsystem’s extension module in wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml as we see in the next section. The
<code>layer-spec.xml</code> and template <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
contain some more information about this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="feature-pack-configuration">Feature pack configuration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/galleon-pack/wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml">galleon-pack/wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml</a>
is used to provision new features (the template
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
explains how to install additions which have no configuration). It adds our extension module
<code>org.wildfly.extension.template-subsystem</code> to the configuration. Galleon is smart enough to inspect this
module’s dependencies and automatically add our <code>org.wildfly.template-dependency</code> module.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The file also sets up the feature packs we depend upon in order to provide the underlying server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="build">Build</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally we have the feature pack build in
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/galleon-pack/pom.xml">galleon-pack/pom.xml</a>.
It contains the <code>wildfly-galleon-maven-plugin</code> which creates the Galleon feature pack. Note that it uses
the <code>build-feature-pack</code> goal which is needed to add a new subsystem along with the mentioned
entry in wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When building the <code>galleon-pack/</code> module you can see what the feature pack contains in the
<code>galleon-pack/target/layout/org.wildfly.extras.galleon-feature-pack-template/template-galleon-pack/&lt;version&gt;/</code>
directory to help you figure out what is missing if your feature pack does not work the way you expected.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="provisioning-a-server">Provisioning a server</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few ways we can provision a server to include our feature pack. They are via a Maven plugin,
or via Galleon CLI. Galleon CLI has a few different ways to provision a server.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="maven-plugin">Maven plugin</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the <code>wildfly-galleon-maven-plugin</code> Maven plugin isn’t really for end users, but it is very handy
to be able to use it from within our project. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/build/pom.xml">build/pom.xml</a>
provisions a server that we can use to verify that our feature pack works. Earlier in this post, we already
played with the server in the <code>build/target</code> directory and deployed our example into that. Also, in our
testsuite, <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/testsuite/integration/subsystem/pom.xml">testsuite/integration/subsystem/pom.xml</a>
provisions a server to run the Arquillian tests against.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In both cases we use the <code>provision</code> goal of the <code>galleon-maven-plugin</code> to provision a server. It lists
the feature packs that our feature pack depends on (note that they are 'transitive') as well as the layers
to install into our server. However, the layers used are slightly different in the two cases since we are
doing two different things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They both need our <code>template-layer</code> of course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>build/</code> version is used to run our example from the <code>example/</code> directory. As this uses a REST endpoint,
we need the <code>jaxrs</code> layer to provide this functionality. Also, the <code>wildfly:deploy</code> goal we used to deploy
the application uses the management interfaces, so it also needs the <code>management</code> layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>testsuite</code> version, on the other hand, does not use REST for the test, so we just use the plain
<code>web-server</code> layer (the <code>jaxrs</code> layer used in <code>build/</code> depends on this <code>web-server</code> layer). Also, since
Arquillian uses JMX to do the interactions with the server, we also need the <code>jmx-remoting</code> layer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="galleon-cli">Galleon CLI</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Galleon CLI is explained in more detail in the
<a href="https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/#_galleon_cli_tool">Galleon documentation</a>. We will look at a few
ideas for how to provision a WildFly server containing our plugin. There are probably other ways too,
Galleon is very powerful! The two main ways to do this are to install the various parts manually, or
to provision it from an xml file. Doing it manually is powerful, but there can be a lot of commands to
remember. If you use an xml file to provision it, everything is contained in that file and you can run
it again and again to provision servers using a simpler to remember command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use the Galleon CLI you need to <a href="https://github.com/wildfly/galleon-plugins/releases">download</a> it.
The following examples assume that you have added the <code>bin/</code> folder of the distribution to your
PATH (This is where the galleon.sh command comes from in the following examples).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will look at how to provision the server via the two main mechanisms, then the <a href="#trying-the-provisioned-server">Trying the provisioned server</a>
section below tells you how to run your application to check that our example subsystem got installed into
the server and works as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="manual-galleon-cli-installation">Manual Galleon CLI installation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To install additional feature packs via Galleon you generally follow the following two steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install the main server - here we can for example choose the version of the main server,
and also trim it down if we don’t want the full server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the feature pack. Note that this part is only possible if the main server was provisioned
via Galleon. It is currently not possible to install feature packs into e.g. the unzipped zip from the
<a href="https://wildfly.org/downloads/">wildfly.org/downloads</a> page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="install-main-server">Install main server</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To install the main server we can do:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$galleon.sh install wildfly:current --dir=wildfly</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This installs all of (i.e. the same as the downloaded zip) the latest WildFly version (at the time
of writing 18.0.1.Final) into the directory specified by the <code>--dir</code> argument. In this case I am using a
relative child directory called <code>wildfly/</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to install a particular version of WildFly you can append the version to <code>wildfly:current</code>. E.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>wildfly:current#18.0.0.Final</code> - installs WildFly 18.0.0.Final.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>wildfly:current#19.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT</code> - installs WildFly from locally built SNAPSHOT maven artifacts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to trim the base server that we install (similar to what we did in the testsuite and the
example server build), you can specify which layers to install by passing in the <code>--layers</code>
option. To install the same server as we had in the <code>build/target/</code> directory that we used to run the example
above, you can run:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$galleon.sh install wildfly:current --dir=wildfly --layers=jaxrs,management</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that we did not install our <code>template-layer</code> because this is unknown in the main
WildFly feature pack. We will add it in the next step.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="install-feature-pack">Install feature pack</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now to install our layer, we run the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$galleon.sh install org.wildfly.extras.galleon-feature-pack-template:template-galleon-pack:1.0.0.Alpha-SNAPSHOT --layers=template-layer --dir=wildfly</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We specify the same directory that we installed the server into in the last step by specifying the same value for
<code>--dir</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>org.wildfly.extras.galleon-feature-pack-template:template-galleon-pack:1.0.0.Alpha-SNAPSHOT</code>
is the Maven GAV of the Galleon feature pack (i.e. what we have in
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/galleon-pack/pom.xml">wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/galleon-pack/pom.xml</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you went with the trimmed server in the previous step, and you look at
<code>wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml</code>, you should see that both the <code>template-subsystem</code>
and the <code>weld</code> subsystems were added in this second step. Weld is our CDI implementation. As we have
seen the 'cdi' layer is a dependency of our layer, so Galleon pulls it in too!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the <a href="#trying-the-provisioned-server">Trying the provisioned server</a> section below for how to start your server and give it a quick
sanity check by deploying and running the example.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="galleon-cli-provision-from-xml-file">Galleon CLI provision from xml file</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative to having to type all the CLI commands we saw every time you want to provision a server is
to use an XML file as input to the Galleon CLI. There is an example in
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/provision.xml">provision.xml</a>.
This file contains all the information needed to provision our server, and as you can see, it lists the
feature pack(s) we depend on, and the feature pack implemented in the template repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each of those we specify the Maven GAV, as in the previous section. We can set what to include
from each feature pack (Refer to the Galleon documentation for more in-depth explanation of what
each setting does). Finally, we say that we want the <code>cloud-profile</code>
and <code>template-layer</code> layers. <code>cloud-profile</code> is just to give you another example base server,
we could have used the same layers as in the previous section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To provision the server, you now simply run the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$galleon.sh provision /path/to/provision.xml --dir=wildfly</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can start the server and run the example as outlined in the <a href="#trying-the-provisioned-server">Trying the provisioned server</a> section.</p>

the sample application that you can deploy into the server. The steps to do this are the same whether you are
using the example server from the <code>build/</code> directory that we saw in the start of this post, or any of the
Galleon CLI mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The example itself is very simple, consisting of a single
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-pack-template/blob/master/example/src/main/java/org/wildfly/extension/galleon/pack/template/example/JaxRsResource.java">REST endpoint</a>
which is injected with a bean made available by the CDI <code>@Produces</code> method from the template subsystem dependency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To run it, first start the server by running (the value of <code>JBOSS_HOME</code> is the root of the built server, which
depends on which flavour of the provisioned server you are trying):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$"${JBOSS_HOME}"/bin/standalone.sh</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then to deploy the application, in another terminal window in the checkout folder of the template project, run:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$mvn package wildfly:deploy -pl example/</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/example/greeting" class="bare">http://localhost:8080/example/greeting</a>, which will output the message created by the CDI producer.
As you refresh, the message will change.</p>

<p>To provision your own subsystem you can copy this template, but of course you should try to give your
subsystem, modules, Galleon constructs, and Java package and class names sensible names for your WildFly
addition. There are quite a few things that need changing, and I have tried to add some hints in the template
source code in the form of TODO comments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This template has not been officially released to Maven. Since it doesn’t do anything useful apart from provide
a framework for you to copy, it is still using a SNAPSHOT version. For your purposes you should create real
tags and releases, and deploy to e.g. Maven Central. Then you can advertise your feature pack to the world,
and it will be easy for people to provision WildFly servers containing your super-cool feature!</p>
