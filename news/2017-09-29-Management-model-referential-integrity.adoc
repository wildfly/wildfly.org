A significant improvement in WildFly 11 is much better support for referential integrity when one resource in your configuration refers to another resource. 
Going beyond just checking that your references are correct, the server provides reference information that our CLI and the HAL web console are able to use 
to suggest valid values to you as you set up your configuration.
 
== Configuration references ==

When you are configuring a WildFly server, a common thing you need to do is configure attributes whose value refers to the name of some other resource. 
A common example of this is a resource that includes a `socket-binding` attribute:

....
[standalone@localhost:9999 /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=ajp)
.... 

When you do this, it's because the services managed by the resource you are configuring need some capabilities provided by another resource. What you're
doing is configuring which one to use. But what kind of resource that `socket-binding` attribute refers to may not be obvious, and what the valid values are
is also not obvious. And before the rollout of improved reference support, if you got it wrong the failure you'd see could be difficult to understand. 

Here, using WildFly 9 with a config where the previously unused 'ajp' socket binding config had been removed, we try and add an AJP listener
to the web container:

....
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=ajp)
{
    "outcome" => "failed",
    "failure-description" => {"WFLYCTL0180: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" => ["jboss.undertow.listener.ajp is missing [jboss.binding.ajp]"]},
    "rolled-back" => true
}
.... 
 
That error message says nothing about where to go to correct the mistake.

Worse, if you made that mistake when working with a server started in `admin-only` mode, that bad reference would not be detected when you entered it. 

....
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] reload --admin-only=true
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=ajp)
{"outcome" => "success"}
....

The configuration would be updated and the problem would only be detected when the server was reloaded or restarted not in `admin-only` mode.
The server would boot but would not function correctly.

== Referential Integrity Checks and Reference Suggestions ==

Starting in WildFly 10 and greatly expanded in WildFly 11, we've added reference description metadata to our resources and attributes, and we use that 
to proactively ensure that management operations that violate referential integrity fail immediately.

The same incorrect operation shown above will now fail immediately, with a message that gives a hint as to where you can configure the missing resource:

....
[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=ajp)
{
    "outcome" => "failed",
    "failure-description" => "WFLYCTL0369: Required capabilities are not available:
    org.wildfly.network.socket-binding.ajp; Possible registration points for this capability: 
		/socket-binding-group=*/socket-binding=*",
    "rolled-back" => true
}
....

The same failure will happen if the server is running in `admin-only` mode (with some exceptions; see "Referential Integrity Checks in an `admin-only` Process"
below.)

If you think the resource you need already exists, but you're not sure of its name, you can use CLI tab completion to get a list of suggestions:

....
[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=    
http  https  management-http  management-https  txn-recovery-environment  txn-status-manager  
[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=
.... 

Once the needed socket binding resource is added, it is available in the tab completion results.

....
[standalone@embedded /] /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=ajp:add(port=8009)
{"outcome" => "success"}
[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=    
ajp                       https                     management-https          txn-status-manager        
http                      management-http           txn-recovery-environment  
[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp:add(socket-binding=ajp)
{"outcome" => "success"}
....

The HAL console will also suggest valid values by means of a pull-down:

If you try and remove a resource whose capabilities are depended upon by other resources, that will also result in a failed operation:

....
[standalone@embedded /] /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=ajp:remove
{
    "outcome" => "failed",
    "failure-description" => "WFLYCTL0367: Cannot remove capability 'org.wildfly.network.socket-binding.ajp' as it is required by other capabilities:
capability 'org.wildfly.undertow.listener.ajp' requires it for attribute 'socket-binding' at address '/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/ajp-listener=ajp'",
    "rolled-back" => true
}
....

== Referential Integrity Checks in an `admin-only` Process ==

If your xml configuration file contains invalid references and you start the server normally, the server will fail to boot and the log will have an 
error message describing the problem. However, if you start the server with the `--admin-only` flag, the server boot will not fail. This is because 
starting in admin-only and manipulating the configuration via the CLI is the recommended way of correcting your configuration. If we didn't allow
the server to boot, the user would have no alternative to manually editing the xml.

When the server is started in this state, no operation will be rejected due to an invalid reference until all referential integrity problems have been 
corrected. Once the configuration reaches a state where there are no integrity issues, thereafter any changes that break integrity will be rejected. 
If a server is started in `admin-only` and has no integrity problems at boot, any changes that break integrity will be rejected. So, leniency in 
integrity checks is only enabled when the server's configuration at boot has problems.  

////
== Additional Benefits ==

The referential integrity features discussed here are based on technology provided by WildFly Core called "capabilities and requirements", a term you
may see in discussions of the development of WildFly. In a nutshell it's a formal system where management resources make known to the WildFly kernel 
what capabilities they provide, and what capabilities they require. The kernel acts as a mediator between required and requiror, allowing 
both looser coupling between parts of the server and stronger checks that all requirements are met. This has benefits to developers of subsystems,
but also has some benefits for end users.

One of these is that if a management operation targeted at a particular resource can't be applied to the runtime, but instead requires a reload 
to take effect, any capability provided by that resource now has a running state inconsistent with its configuration. This condition lasts until
a reload or restart occurs. But, due to its tracking of capabilities and requires, the kernel knows what other resources provide 
capabilities that require, directly or transitively, the affected capability. The kernel will use this knowledge and disable applying changes to
the runtime for those resources as well, even if they would otherwise be allowed. This ensures the runtime remains in a consistent state.

An example of this kind of scenario is TODO

Another example of this kind of thing is removing a resource and then re-adding it (i.e. with a different configuration) without an intervening reload. 
A removal often results in putting the server in reload-required state, as the operation won't immediately remove services provided by the resource. 
But prior to WildFly 11 the re-add would try to install the resource's services, resulting in confusing duplicate service failures. In WildFly 11, 
the capability tracking allows the kernel to be aware that the configuration doesn't reflect the runtime services, so it won't try and re-add
those services. The user needs to reload the server to get a set of runtime services that match the configuration.
////
== Further Work == 
 
The referential integrity functionality discussed here first began to appear in WildFly 10, but it's use was greatly expanded in WildFly 11, and
the use of it to drive CLI tab completion and HAL pulldowns is new in 11. But still, we don't yet have complete coverage of all capabilities
subsystems provide, although the bulk of cases are covered, particularly those involve configuration attributes. Rollout of the use of capabilities
will continue in future WildFly releases.
