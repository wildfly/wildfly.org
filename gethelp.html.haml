          %p
            WildFly's user forums should be your first port of call for any user-related issues with WildFly.  Be it a question, wanting to report a bug, looking for advice, or simply sharing some cool stories you may have.

              If you are asking for help, have you read through the
              %a{:href => "https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY10/Documentation"} documentation
              first?  You may find your answer there.
            %p
              Also, if you are reporting a bug, have you checked our
              %a{:href => "http://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY"} bug tracker
              first?  It may be a known issue.

          %h2 Developers Mailing List
          %p
            This is a mailing list geared towards developing WildFly itself.  It often contains deep, technical discussions on how WildFly works internally, how new features could be implemented, and is definitely not the place for end user questions such as how to configure, use or even troubleshoot WildFly.  Please use the User Forums for such questions.
          %p
            If, however, you are helping contribute to WildFly, we welcome your thoughts, ideas and overall participation on the developers' mailing list.
