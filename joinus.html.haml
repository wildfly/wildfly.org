      %h2 Why should I join?
      %p WildFly is not only 100% open source, it is also developed for and by its community of users.  Developers join from all over the world, and they contribute in many different ways. We are grateful for all contributions, whether it be a new feature, a bug fix, wiki entires, helping other members, or even just filing a bug report. The relationship is symbiotic, every contribution you make encourages others to in turn contribute in ways that will likely benefit you. The experience is also rewarding. Let's look at why.

            Build It
          %p 
            The first step to get started is to build WildFly yourself. This requires creating a
            %a{:href=>"http://github.com"} GitHub
            account, forking WildFly, and cloning your private fork. The
            %a{:href=>"https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HackingOnWildFly"} "Hacking On WildFly"
            wiki article contains complete instructions for this and the patch construction and submission process. 
          %h4
            %i.icon-search
            Find Something To Work On
          %p 
            After you are comfortable building the server, the next step is to find something that you would like to work on. Scan through
            %a{:href=>"http://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY"} bug tracking system
            and look for an issue you would like to fix. We also stick features that have not been scheduled / assigned into a special version called
            %a{:href=>"https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY/fixforversion/12321689"} Awaiting Volunteers.
            It is usually best to start with something small though like a minor priority bug. If you need help locating a task, feature, or bug to work on, just 
            %a{:href => "https://www.hipchat.com/gW90m6pIs"} join our HipChat channel
            and ask for help. When you do locate an issue be sure to announce you intention in the JIRA so that others don't end up duplicating your effort.

            Subscribe to our Mailing List
          %p 
            If you are intending to contribute, it's a good idea to 
            %a{:href => "https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/wildfly-dev"} join the development mailing list.
            All design and general development discussions take place on this list. We also will send out important notifications, like release schedule updates and system availability.

            Submit A Pull Request
          %p Follow the directions in the above linked wiki article on how to submit the pull request. Once your pull request is submitted our automated CI environment will test it, and report any test failures. You will get email notifications in case this happens. A reviewer will also perform a human review, and request additional changes or clarification if required.
