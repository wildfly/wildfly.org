        <h2 class="page-subtitle">The Wild<strong>Fly</strong> community and our sponsor, Red Hat, take security bugs very
            seriously
        </h2>
        <p>We aim to take immediate action to address serious security-related problems that involve our projects.
            Note that we will only fix such issues in the most recent minor release of Wild<strong>Fly</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Reporting of Security Issues</h2>
        <p>When reporting a security vulnerability it is important to not accidentally broadcast to the world that the
            issue exists, as this makes it easier for people to exploit it. The software industry uses the term
            <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/security-embargoes-red-hat">embargo</a> to describe the time a security
            issue is known internally until it is public knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our preferred way of reporting security issues in Wild<strong>Fly</strong> and its related projects is listed below.
        </p>

        <h2>Email the mailing list</h2>
        <p>The list at <a href="mailto:security@wildfly.org">security@wildfly.org</a> is the preferred mechanism for outside users
            to report security issues. A member of the Wild<strong>Fly</strong> team will open the required issues.</p>

            If you would like to work with us on a fix for the security vulnerability, please include your GitHub username

        <p>
            Do not open a public issue, send a pull request, or disclose any information about the suspected vulnerability
