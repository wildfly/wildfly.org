You can start an application server Docker container, and deploy a given application within it and execute Arquillian tests.
Or you can easily build your application image, run it on Kubernetes or OpenShift and execute tests against it. And that's not just about applications. Arquillian Cube can deploy any required services, like databases, mail servers, etc. replacing the need for mocking fake objects. Annotations are available to inject relevant resources directly into your test classes, and you can use Arquillian Cube APIs to orchestrate your tested services lifecycle. Whatever the platform that you use in production, your tests will be executed against it, making them even more real, effective and meaningful than before.
